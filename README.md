# swigql

[swig](https://github.com/paularmstrong/swig) templating for SQL

## Installation

	npm install swigql

## Examples

### Template code

```
SELECT
  id
  , first_name
  , last_name
FROM person
WHERE
  first_name = {% bind fn %}
  AND (
  {%- for ln in last_names -%}
      {% if loop.index > 1 %}OR {% endif %}last_name = {% bind ln %}
  {% endfor -%}
  )
```

### node.js code

```javascript
var swigql = require('swigql');

var tmpl = swigql.compileFile('/path/to/template.sql');
var results = tmpl.render({
	fn: 'James',
	last_names: ['Franklin', 'Cooper', 'Smitty', 'Black']
});

console.log(results);
```

### Output

```
[ 'SELECT\n  id\n  , first_name\n  , last_name\nFROM person\nWHERE\n  first_name = $1\n  AND (last_name = $2\n OR last_name = $3\n OR last_name = $4\n OR last_name = $5\n )',
  [ 'James', 'Franklin', 'Cooper', 'Smitty', 'Black' ] ]
```

## Notes

swigql is simply a wrapper around swig with two differences:

1. swigql adds a custom tag to swig named `bind`. This tag will substitute the
   variable with the appropriate positional parameter (ex. $1).

2. Instead of returning just the output of the template, it also returns the
   bind parameters in an array suitable for passing to a database driver such
   as [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg).

Bringing some powerful features of swig templating, such as [template
inheritance](http://paularmstrong.github.com/swig/docs/#inheritance) opens the
door for some interesting possibilities for writing reusable sql queries.  For
example, you could have a base query that you can extend to add more fields to
the SELECT, or more conditions to the WHERE clause.

### Example base query template

```
SELECT
	{% block select %}
	id
	{% endblock %}
FROM tbl
	{% block joins %}
	{% endblock %}
WHERE 1=1
	{% block where %}
	{% endblock %}
```

### Example sub query template

```
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block select %}
	{% parent %}
	, my_fk
{% endblock %}

{% block joins %}
{% parent %}
INNER JOIN other_tbl USING (my_fk)
{% endblock %}

{% block where %}
	AND my_fk = {% bind myVal %}
{% endblock %}
```
